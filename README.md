# Advanced-Bayesian-Optimization-for-Hyperparameter-Tuning-in-Deep-Learning
This project applies Bayesian Optimization to tune deep learning hyperparameters efficiently using Optuna or Scikit-Optimize. It trains a CNN on CIFAR-10, builds probabilistic search over parameters like learning rate, filters, and batch size, and identifies the best configuration with fewer evaluations.
